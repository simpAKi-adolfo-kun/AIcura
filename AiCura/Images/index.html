            <p>What opportunities does AI provide for improving patient care and disease management?</p>
            <button class="faq-btn">+</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">AI offers numerous opportunities to enhance patient care and disease management by detecting even the earliest signs of degenerative diseases, including in asymptomatic patients, which allows for timely intervention and slows disease progression. It also enables the analysis of complex data, allowing for the personalization of treatment plans and real-time patient monitoring, leading to instantaneous adjustments in care. Additionally, AI-powered devices provide convenience and support to caregivers by helping manage care routines and reducing burnout, ultimately improving the quality of care delivered. AI facilitates remote monitoring through wearable and IoT devices, allowing critical health monitoring outside of clinical settings and extending healthcare access to patients with mobility challenges or those preferring to stay at home. Moreover, AI accelerates the discovery of new drugs by identifying potential compounds and predicting their effectiveness, enhancing treatment outcomes for specific degenerative diseases.</div>

            <p>What are the potential benefits of AlCura for caregivers?</p>
            <button class="faq-btn">+</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">AlCura offers substantial support and convenience for caregivers. The AI tools can assist in managing care routines, continuously monitoring patients, and alleviating caregiver burnout. This support enables caregivers to provide more effective care while experiencing reduced emotional and physical strain.</div>

            <p>How does AICura aid in the early detection of diseases?</p>
            <button class="faq-btn">+</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">AlCura, as highlighted in the document, leverages AI to detect diseases at an early stage, even when symptoms are minor or absent. This early detection is crucial because it allows for timely preventative measures and interventions. By identifying diseases like cancer in their initial phases, AlCura can significantly improve patient outcomes and potentially reduce long-term treatment costs. The AI system can analyze data from wearable devices to spot subtle changes in health metrics that traditional check-ups might miss.</div>
